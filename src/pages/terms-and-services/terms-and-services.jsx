              <h6>1. Overview</h6>
              <p>
                This Agreement applies to Customer’s Orders for Products and related
                Support and Advisory Services. The terms of this Agreement apply to
                both Cloud Products and Software Products, although certain terms
                apply only to Cloud Products or Software Products, as specified
                below. In addition, some Products are subject to additional
                Product-Specific Terms, and Support and Advisory Services are
                subject to the applicable Policies.
              </p>
              <h6>2. Use of Products</h6>
              <p>
                <strong>2.1. Permitted Use.</strong> Subject to this Agreement and
                during the applicable Subscription Term, Orchestr8 grants Customer a
                non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Products and related
                Support and Advisory Services for its and its Affiliates’ internal
                business purposes, in accordance with the Documentation and
                Customer’s Scope of Use.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2.2. Restrictions.</strong> Except to the extent otherwise
                expressly permitted by this Agreement, Customer must not (and must
                not permit anyone else to): (a) rent, lease, sell, distribute or
                sublicense the Products or (except for Affiliates) include them in a
                service bureau or outsourcing offering, (b) provide access to the
                Products to a third party, other than to Users, (c) charge its
                customers a specific fee for use of the Products, but Customer may
                charge an overall fee for its own offerings (of which the Products
                are ancillary), (d) use the Products to develop a similar or
                competing product or service, (e) reverse engineer, decompile,
                disassemble or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to
                the Products, (f) modify or create derivative works of the Products,
                (g) interfere with or circumvent Product usage limits or Scope of
                Use restrictions, (h) remove, obscure or modify in any way any
                proprietary or other notices or attributions in the Products, or (i)
                violate the Acceptable Use Policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2.3. DPA.</strong> The DPA applies to Customer’s use of
                Products and related Support and Advisory Services and forms part of
                this Agreement.
              </p>
              <h6>3. Users</h6>
              <p>
                <strong>3.1. Responsibility.</strong> Customer may authorize Users
                to access and use the Products, in accordance with the Documentation
                and Customer’s Scope of Use. Customer is responsible for its Users’
                compliance with this Agreement and all activities of its Users,
                including Orders they may place, apps and Third Party-Products
                enabled, and how Users access and use Customer Data.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3.2. Login Credentials.</strong> Customer must ensure that
                each User keeps its login credentials confidential and must promptly
                notify Orchestr8 if it becomes aware of any unauthorized access to
                any User login credentials or other unauthorized access to or use of
                the Products.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3.3. Domain Ownership.</strong> Where a Cloud Product
                requires Customer to specify a domain (such as www.example.com) for
                the Cloud Product’s or a feature’s operation, Orchestr8 may verify
                that Customer or an Affiliate owns or controls that domain.
                Orchestr8 has no obligation to provide that Cloud Product or feature
                if Orchestr8 cannot verify that Customer or an Affiliate owns or
                controls the domain. Product administrators appointed by Customer
                may also take over management of accounts previously registered
                using an email address belonging to Customer’s domain, which become
                “managed accounts” (or similar term), as described in the
                Documentation.
